      <h2>From Ashes to Glory</h2>
      <p>
        PHANTOM VI was founded in 2015 by <strong>Vincent Makafu</strong> in the Free State with a vision to create a unique and memorable drink experience.
        Starting from humble beginnings, Vincent refined his craft, poured heart into branding, and built lasting relationships with distilleries and bottle decorators across the country.
      </p>
      <p>
        After years of perseverance and passion, PHANTOM VI now proudly operates in <strong>Colesberg</strong>, offering custom wine, gin, and vodka bottles. Vincent is recognized as a pioneer in personalized liquor branding — “the best in the game.”
