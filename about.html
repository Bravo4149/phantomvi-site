      <h2>From Ashes to Glory</h2>
      <p>
        PHANTOM VI was founded in 2015 by <strong>Vincent Makafu</strong> in the Free State. What started as a dream with almost nothing has grown into one of South Africa’s most unique custom alcohol brands. Through years of perseverance, passion, and perfection, Vincent now operates PHANTOM VI from Colesberg, leading the game in custom wines, gins, and vodkas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, PHANTOM VI is known for helping others build their own liquor brands, print custom labels, and make unforgettable impressions with personalized bottles.
