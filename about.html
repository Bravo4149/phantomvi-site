      <h2>From Ashes to Glory</h2>
      <p>
        PHANTOM VI was established in 2015 by <strong>Vincent Makafu</strong> in the Free State province of South Africa.
        Born with a burning passion for branding, Vincent started with humble beginnings, selling only a few bottles with hand-made labels. 
        Over the years, through perseverance and pure genius, he grew PHANTOM VI into one of the most respected names in custom-labelled liquor production.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, PHANTOM VI operates out of Colesberg, offering premium-quality wine, gin, and vodka, uniquely crafted and custom-labeled for events, businesses, and personal brands.
        With a commitment to taste, aesthetics, and experience — we transform ordinary bottles into unforgettable masterpieces.
