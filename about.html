    <h2>Our Story: From Ashes to Glory</h2>
    <p>
      PHANTOM VI was founded in 2015 by Vincent Makafu in the Free State, South Africa. With nothing more than ambition, creativity, and a deep love for premium spirits, Vincent began producing small-batch wines and gins in his hometown. Through trials, lessons, and an unshakable belief in his dream, PHANTOM VI grew from humble beginnings into a recognized brand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, Vincent operates out of Colesberg — still hands-on in the development, branding, and bottling process. Known for his unmatched eye for aesthetics and flavor, he is now considered one of the most dynamic players in the South African custom spirits market.
    </p>
    <p>
      PHANTOM VI specializes in custom bottles of wine, gin, and vodka — uniquely crafted for events, gifts, and new liquor brands. From design to labeling and final delivery, every bottle is made with precision and pride.
    </p>

    <h2>Licensing & Compliance</h2>
    <p>
      PHANTOM VI operates under strict compliance with South African laws regarding the production and distribution of alcohol.
    </p>
    <p>
      All production is done via licensed manufacturing partners. Our team provides assistance to individuals and businesses who wish to enter the alcohol industry without the initial hurdle of licensing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Need Licensing Help?</strong> We help you sell under our license temporarily and guide you when you’re ready to apply for your own. The licensing process in South Africa may cost between R5,000 – R50,000 and takes 6–24 months.
    </p>
    <p>
      Products sold through PHANTOM VI must always adhere to South African liquor regulations and are primarily for demonstration, corporate gifting, and promotional purposes until licensed independently.
